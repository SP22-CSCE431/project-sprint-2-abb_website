## Deployment ##
To deploy your app to Heroku, use the git push command to push the code from your local repositoryâ€™s main branch to your heroku remote. 
Use this same command whenever you want to deploy the latest committed version of your code to Heroku.

Heroku only deploys code that you push to the master or main branches of the remote. Pushing code to another branch of the heroku remote has no effect.
